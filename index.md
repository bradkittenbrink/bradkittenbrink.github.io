About Me
--------

I'm a dad of 2 and a software engineer in San Francisco.  I like building things that help others to build new things.

I'm currently looking for work located in San Francisco.  I'm a software generalist with a focus on backend api systems.  Here is my [resume](assets/bradkittenbrink.pdf)


Job Search
----------

I'm primarily looking for positions as Backend Software Engineer or similar. I'm also interested in Android Engineer or Mobile Engineer type roles.

What I'm looking for in a company:
- Must support women & minorities & other marginalized groups in leadership roles.
- No particular product focus, other than no Fin-tech and I prefer products that users actually pay for.
- Prefer medium size company, although open to other sizes
- Prefer office located in SF, ideally in FiDi or SoMa (maybe Mission/Potrero), since it's becoming ridiculously slow to get out of the city from North Beach.

If you know of a role I might be a good fit for or a company that is doing interesting stuff, please let me know!
