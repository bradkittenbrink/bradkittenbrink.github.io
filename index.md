About Me

I'm a dad of 2 and a software engineer in San Francisco.  I like building things that help others to build new things.

I'm currently looking for work located in San Francisco.  I'm a software generalist with a focus on backend api systems.  Here is my [resume](assets/bradkittenbrink.pdf)
